# ColorServer
DePaul University CSC435

The assignment:
The downloadable source code:

ColorServer.java
ColorClient.java
Read through this assignment page and the ColorServer checklist.
Create a development directory for ColorServer.
Download the ColorServer.java and ColorClient.java files.
Scan through the code of both programs to get a feel for what they do. Read all the comments.
Adjust your JDK version to one that is compatible with the class standard version this quarter.
Compile the files (you may have to issue "javac *.java" twice to pick up all four classes).
Start the server in one terminal window, and one client in another terminal window. [In window one: java ColorServer. In window two: java ColorClient.]
Play with the system to make sure you know how it works. If you use an IDE you may have to figure out how to run multi-process programs under it.
Run again, but this time with more than one client at the same time. Use a different Username for each client.
If you have a second monitor, bring the .java code up on it. Otherwise print the programs out.
Unless you are already a competent network java programer TYPE IN the two programs yourself. We want all the code and comments to go in through your eyes, be processed by your brain as precise symbols of thought, reformatted as language (including both written and spoken versions), translated into motor actions, and entered into the visual language symbols of Java through your fingers. In the background you will engage in algorithmic, big-picture thinking whether you want to or not. Get the two programs compiling and running a little bit at a time. As long as the programs run the same, you are free to (and encouraged to) make small changes in the code as you wish. Always keep the programs running. You'll have to diagnose your mistakes, and you'll make small changes along the way. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
Remove my comments (except the "Thanks" URLs) and ADD YOUR OWN EXPLANATORY COMMENTS about how the programs work. REQUIRED.
Add the required class header for java files, including, e.g., java version, your name and the date.
Make small changes and additions to the program functionality as your creative spirit wishes. Explain the modifications at the bottom of the checklist.
Make sure that your code all compiles from the command line with "javac *.java" (possibly executed twice). This is how we will compile and grade all your assignments.
Remove all "pacakge" statements from your java code. We will not compile with packages and will not look for your code in subdirectories.
Read and follow ALL of the D2L submission specifications for this class. See the class web page.
Complete the ColorServer checklist. Note: making false claims on a checklist is an academic integrity violation.
Zip your fully compiling and running JAVA SOURCE CODE and CHECKLIST (only) together (standard ZIP format / no other formats accepted). All the files must be in one directory. Do not include any .class files. Do not use any subdirectories.
Submit the ColorServer.zip file to D2L before the D2L server-closing deadline.
SUGGESTED: Download, unzip, compile and run your .java code from D2L to make sure it has not been corrupted. It is always your responsibility to ensure the file has not been damaged during upload. There is no "re-upload" after the assignment deadline.
Concatenate your .java code (only! no checklists!) into a .docx, .html or .txt file named ColorAll.docx, ColorAll.html or ColorAll.txt. Submit to the ColorServer TII link.
Your TII report will be heavily flagged for plagiarism, which FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT ONLY is fine, because you have copied my code. Your comments should be original however, and not heavily flagged.
Congratulate yourself on completing the assignment as a Java Network Programmer.
